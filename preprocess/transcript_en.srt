1
00:00:57,237 --> 00:01:04,063
Even in the midst of flowing time, oppression spins round and round.

2
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:11,262
I can't even see the heart that's leaving me, didn't you know?

3
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:18,000
I can't even get myself to move, slipping through the cracks of time.

4
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:24,915
I don't know anything about what's around me,
I'm just me and no more.

5
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:27,980
Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing?

6
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,417
Are my words useless even if I speak?

7
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:38,383
I'm just tired of being sad
I should go on without feeling anything

8
00:01:38,383 --> 00:01:45,395
Even if you give me the words; I'm at 
 a loss for
My heart just won't pay attention

9
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:52,320
If I can move, if everything changes, it will go dark.

10
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:55,730
Is there a future for someone like me?

11
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:59,350
Will I still exist in a world like this?

12
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:06,208
Is this painful? Is it sad?
Not even knowing myself.

13
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm just tired even of walking, I don't even understand people.

14
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:20,060
If someone like me can change, if I change, will it turn white?

15
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:55,750
Even in the midst of flowing time, oppression spins round and round.

16
00:02:55,752 --> 00:03:02,346
I can't even see the heart that's leaving me, didn't you know?

17
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:09,359
I can't even get myself to move slipping through the cracks of time.

18
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:16,320
I don't know anything about what's around me, I'm just me and no more.

19
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:22,730
Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing? Are my words useless even if I speak?

20
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:29,620
I'm just tired of being sad;
I should go on without feeling anything.

21
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:36,898
Even if you give me the words; I'm at 
 a loss for
My heart just won't pay attention.

22
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:43,460
If I can move, if everything changes, it will go dark.

23
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,580
Is there a future to come out of this useless 
 time?
Will I exist in a place like this?

24
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:57,630
If I wanted to tell you what kind of person I 
 am, the words I'd use would be "good for nothing".

25
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:04,506
Will I exist in a place like this?
Will 
 I exist in a time like this?

26
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:11,519
If someone like me can change, if I change, will it turn white?

27
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,340
Am I dreaming now? Or seeing nothing?
Are my words useless even if I speak?

28
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:25,250
I'm just tired of being sad;
I should go on without feeling anything.

29
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:32,417
Even if you give me the words I'm at a 
 loss for, my heart just won't pay attention.

30
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:39,429
If I can move, if everything changes, it will all go dark.

31
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:46,256
If I move, If I move,
everything will break, everything will break.

32
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:53,120
If I'm sad, if I'm sad, will my heart be able to turn white?

33
00:04:53,125 --> 00:05:00,095
I still know nothing about you, about me, about anything.

34
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:07,460
If I can open my heavy eyelids, if I break everything, turn black!
