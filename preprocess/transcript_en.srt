1
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:36,150
Even in the midst of flowing time, I feel languid, look, spinning around and around

2
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:43,100
I can't even see the heart that's leaving me, didn't you know?

3
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:50,000
I can't even get myself to move, I continue to be washed down the cracks of time

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't know anything about what's around me, I'm just me and no more

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,530
Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing? My words are useless even if I speak

6
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,460
I'm just tired of being sad, I should go on without feeling anything

7
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:17,360
Even if you give me the words I'm at a loss for, my heart just won't pay attention

8
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,400
If I move myself away, if I change everything, I’ll turn it all black

9
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,260
Is there a future for someone like me? Will I still exist in a world like this?

10
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:38,330
Is this painful? Is it sad? Not even knowing myself

11
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:45,260
I'm just tired even of walking, I don't even understand people.

12
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:52,630
If someone like me can change, if I can change, will I turn white?

13
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:13,540
Even in the midst of flowing time, I feel languid, look, spinning around and around

14
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,440
I can't even see the heart that's leaving me, didn't you know?

15
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:27,400
I can't even get myself to move, I continue to be washed down the cracks of time

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I don't know anything about what's around me, I'm just me and no more

17
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,970
Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing? My words are useless even if I speak

18
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:47,900
I'm just tired of being sad, I should go on without feeling anything

19
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:54,800
Even if you give me the words I'm at a loss for, my heart just won't pay attention

20
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,700
If I can move, if I change everything, I’ll turn it all black

21
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:08,760
If I move, if I move, I’ll destroy everything, I’ll destroy everything

22
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,800
If I grieve, if I grieve, can my heart turn white?

23
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,630
I still don’t know about you, about myself, about everything

24
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:30,090
If I can open my heavy eyelids, if I break everything, then turn black!!!
